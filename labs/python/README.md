
Concise Overview
----------------
This is a minimal lab for practicing incremental, AI‑assisted improvements to a Python producer–consumer pattern (threads + queue + sentinel).

Student Documentation
---------------------
All learning guidance, prompt ladder, and spec live in the `docs/` folder:
- `docs/specs.md` – minimal lab spec (requirements & interfaces)
- `docs/README.md` – prompt ladder & usage guidance

Getting Started
---------------
Open the docs, load them into your AI assistant’s context, then follow the prompt ladder. Keep changes small and test frequently.
