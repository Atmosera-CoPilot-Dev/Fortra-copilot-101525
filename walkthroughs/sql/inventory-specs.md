Requirements 
1. Consistent naming & keys: singular tables, primary key id, foreign keys <table>_id, constraint names fk_<table>_<column>.
2. Data integrity: enforce referential integrity; constrain lengths and use precise data types.
3. Performance: efficient queries with appropriate types; nonclustered indexes on foreign key columns.
4. Encapsulated logic: views, stored procedures, functions, triggers for reusable automation.
5. Testability: seed representative sample data to validate schema and generated scripts.
