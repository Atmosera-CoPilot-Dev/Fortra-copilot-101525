
These steps incrementally build a web app that uses Node.js and Express with React components and Jest testing.

Use these recommended versions:
- Node.js: 20.x LTS (latest stable LTS)
- Express: 4.18.x (most widely supported, stable)
- React: 18.x (latest stable major, widely adopted)
-Jest: 29.x or 30.x (latest stable, compatible with React 18)


Step 1: I need help scaffolding a web app that will use NodeJS and Express. It should include the React library with sample components and support for testing using Jest. 
- Use these recommended versions:
- Node.js: 20.x
- Express: 4.18.x 
- React: 18.x 
- Jest: 29.x

Step 2: Create the project structure and provide a basic setup for the server and client side. The components are as follows:
'Welcome' - A simple component that display a random welcome message.
'TodoList' - A component that displays a list of todo items with the ability to add and remove items.

Step 3: Configure Jest to work with the React components.

Step 4: Refactor to use routing for each component. For example the default url would be a welcome page, http://localhost:9000/Welcome would display the welcome component, etc. 

Step 5: How do I deploy my Node.js and Express web app to Heroku?
